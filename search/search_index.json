These rocks are based on 4 types. These types are cubic, boulder, quartz and custom. Cubic A cubic rock type only has a dimension (x,y,z). This is the scale of the rock you are going to create. Boulder A boulder rock type has a radius variable. This rock will be spherical. Quartz The quartz type is where you can create crystal type rocks. You have several options to play with. Variable Description Protrustion How much the tip of the crystal 'sticks out' Flat Tip How pointy the tip of the crystal is Height The base height of the crystal Width The base width of the crystal Tetragonal This will make the crystal have 4 sides instead of 6 One Sided Whether the crystal has 2 pointy ends or not Custom You can also generate rocks based on custom shapes. Just drag in a mesh shape and the system will generate a low poly rock that's based on that shape. Don't use complex meshes for this because the algorithm is very slow. You are better of just using cubic, boulder or quartz but you really want to, it's an option. Materials In the materials section you can assign 4 materials. These are the materials that the generated rock will randomly pick from. This is useful to create a 'palette' of 4 colors to have some variation in the colors of your rock. Saving In the saving section you can pick the name of the rock you'll be generating as well as the collider type that will be attached to the rock. Sometimes you will also see a 'xyz' button in this section. This is the orientation of the rock that will be generated. Just click on the button to change the orientation.","title":"Basic Rock Generation"},{"location":"basic/#cubic","text":"A cubic rock type only has a dimension (x,y,z).

Simply add a parent object into the slot and all the children of that parent object will be combined into 1 mesh. You can also pick a name for the new combined rock mesh and you have also several options to choose the type of collider you want, whether or not multiple materials should be preserved, if the new rock should have a rigidbody and if the old meshes should be removed.

The asset will create a folder 'Ameye' under your Assets directory. Basic setup A 'RockStudio' menu will appear under 'Tools' in the menu bar. If click Tools > RockStudio > RockStudio, the RockStudio window will open up, it looks like this. We will start by creating a basic rock in the scene. The main menu of the RockStudio window is called the basic rock generation menu , here you will create your rocks. To test this function just press 'Generate' at the bottom of the window and a gizmo will appear in the scene view. Move it to the location where you want to spawn a rock and press down the left button of your mouse. This will create a rock object in the scene. It will have the default grey material since all the materials under the 'Materials' section are grey. Note that the rocks you create a put in a 'rock group' in your hierarchy. Now that we have created our first rocks, we can explore the tool further. You can find more information in other sections.","title":"Quick-Start"},{"location":"quickstart/#quick-start","text":"","title":"Quick-Start"},{"location":"quickstart/#importing","text":"First of all, import the asset into your project.

Generation Firstly you can pick the 'resolution' of the rocks. The higher this number, the more vertices the rock will have and if you increase this number, the rock will have more facets.

You can set it to random if you want rocks to be random all the time or you can pick 1 seed so that rocks will always look the same.
